Bank Sampah Kenanga: Empowering Women Through Waste Recycling

Bank Sampah Kenanga is a waste processing facility located in Palembang, Indonesia. It transforms waste into useful products, empowering local women from Kelurahan 19 Ilir to increase their income through micro-enterprises (UMKM). Every Friday, the bank collects and weighs various types of recyclable materials, including paper, plastic bottles, plastic shards, aluminum, cardboard, and cans. These materials are then processed using a shredder to increase efficiency. The collected materials are valued based on their market price, allowing customers to save and earn profits from their waste.

We're from a team of computer science students Universitas Sriwijaya, are developing an expert system to improve waste sorting efficiency. The system aims to automate the process of determining whether waste is recyclable, reusable, or non-recyclable.
